<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>
  Luckily I haven’t had to create an email page or template for quite a while now. I say <em>luckily </em>because it can be a real headache sometimes. Especially if you want your e-mail to look the same in all mailing clients, including
  freemail ones like hotmail and gmail. A friend of mine who has just started meddling with the mighty powers of HTML was in a bit of a bind over this and after sorting him out I thought I’d better put the sites I use as a resource on here
  as well.
</p>
<h3>The List</h3>
<p>
  Anand Graves has been an absolute saint by giving the web the <a title="HTML email guide" href="http://www.anandgraves.com/html-email-guide" target="_blank">HTML email Guide</a> complimented with
  a <a title="HTML Email Validator" href="http://www.anandgraves.com/html-email-validator/" target="_blank">HTML Email Validator</a> which is an absolute lifesaver. For those
  really-hard-to-pinpoint-problems one can always check <a title="Email Standards Project" href="http://www.email-standards.org/" target="_blank">the Email Standards Project</a> and their excessive
  <a title="Email Clients" href="http://www.email-standards.org/clients/" target="_blank">list of email clients</a> and which parts of CSS they support.
</p>
<p>
  If your list of has-to-look-the-same-across-these-different-mail-clients includes more than 2 you’d better take a look at the chart on this article about
  <a title="CSS support in email clients" href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS support in email clients</a>.
</p>
<p>If that still isn’t enough for ya you’d probably want to trawl <a title="the Mailchimp Blog " href="http://www.mailchimp.com/blog/" target="_blank">the Mailchimp Blog</a>.</p>
<p>
  The single most important thing besides having your mail look good is that it actually gets delivered. In that respect
