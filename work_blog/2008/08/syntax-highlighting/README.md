<p>
  Because this blog is mainly about web development inevitably have some code posted to it. And because nobody likes to look at code in plain text (except, maybe, the most die hard group of vi fanatics) I’ll have to add some form of code
  highlighting to these pages.
</p>
<p>There are several quite good solutions out there and I really have no desire to try and create my own, so the only question I have to answer is: Which one shall I choose?</p>
<p>
  By now you may be aware that that’s never a question I can reply to with a straight answer. This case is no exception. First I’ll have to build a list of solutions available to me out there , then I’ll need to decide if I prefer a server
  or a client side solution and THEN I’ll be able to pick one… Best start building that list real quick or I won’t get anything else done ’till Christmas… Of course the smartest way to go is look at syntax highlighters that are already
  ported to a WP-plugin.
</p>
<h2>The List</h2>
<h3>WP-plugins:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a title="Wordpress Plugin: WP-CodeBox @http://wordpress.org/" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-codebox/" target="_blank">WP-CodeBox</a> (uses GeSHI)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Server Side:</h3>
