<h2>The Pitch</h2>
<p>
  Recently, in a discussion about coders and coding styles I suggested, as a joke, that maybe we should have coders take a test of some sort to know what type of coder they are, so we can more realistically evaluate if we think their ideas
  or opinions are compatible with our own. Yesterday I remembered once having taken a test of some sort on the very same subject and today, after
  <a title="http://www.google.com/search?q=programmer+type+test" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=programmer+type+test">some searching</a>, I found it. Actually, I found two.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a title="Programmer Personality Test" href="http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11" target="_blank">Programmer Personality Test</a> based on the Myers-Briggs Personality Test</li>
  <li>
    <a style="text-decoration: line-through;" title="Jungian Type Test For Programmers" href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/mb/" target="_blank">Jungian Type Test For Programmers</a> (
    <span class="update">UPDATE 14-12-2008: sadly the page holding this test is dead…)</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I thought it might be a fun idea to post these tests here, noting my current score, and then revisiting them some time in the future to see if anything changed. Also, because both tests are based on a well established test, I think I
  should take the original tests too, to compare the outcome.
</p>
<h2>The results</h2>
<p>My programmer personality type is:<span style="font-size: large;">DHSB</span><strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>
<hr />
<strong>I’m a <span style="font-size: large;">D</span>oer.</strong><br />
I am very quick at getting tasks done. I believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster I can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money.
<p></p>
<p>
  <strong>I like coding at a <span style="font-size: large;">H</span>igh level.</strong><br />
  The world is made up of objects and components, I should create my programs in the same way.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I work best in a <span style="font-size: large;">S</span>olo situation.</strong><br />
  The best way to program is by myself. There’s no communication problems, I know every part of the code allowing me to write the best programs possible.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am a li<span style="font-size: large;">B</span>eral programmer.</strong><br />
  Programming is a complex task and I should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We’re not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.
</p>
<hr />
My Jungian Type has been switching betwwen&nbsp; <span style="font-size: large;">ENTP</span> and <span style="font-size: large;">ENFP</span>, depending on when I took the test.<br />
I feel the Jung-type tests are common enough to not include the complete conclusion here, but I’m curious if one or the other of the two types will become a stable result. Maybe I am in a transitional period in my life? Maybe a person has
several types and it depends on the situation and surroundings which one is more dominant? Maybe it’s time to keep a diary and plot a graph and find out!
