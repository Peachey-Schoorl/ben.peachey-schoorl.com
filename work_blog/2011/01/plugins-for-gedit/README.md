  Reading through my news feed over at <a title="social Coding > GitHub.com" rel="homepage" href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> I noticed that the esteemed
  <a title="The guy who makes the www fun > paulirish.com" href="http://paulirish.com/" target="_blank">Paul Irish</a> had created a new Git repository. Because
  <del>I have an inquisitive mind</del> I am nosey, I clicked through to investigate things and came across something quite interesting… But first some background information.
</p>
<p>
  When I started out learning web development, I frequently looked things up on
  <a title="outfated resource > W3Schools.com" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools.com</a>. Now, thanks to my
  <a title="My current IDE of choice > Netbeans" href="http://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">IDE</a>, other resources and years of experience I don’t really visit there any more. And, also,
  &nbsp;because of the… uhm… <em>other</em> reason. The one that has been circulating the web for years but somehow never gained much momentum.&nbsp;The
  <a title='Explanation of the saying "Elephant in the room" > Wikipedia' rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room" target="_blank">elephant-in-the-room</a> reason. I
  am, of course, referring to the&nbsp;fact that the information over at W3Schools is, in general, outdated, incomplete or wrong up to the &nbsp;point of were it has become a bit of an embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
  I guess that the main reason no-one ever really tore into this, is the fact that most of us&nbsp;start out in web development with a lot of help from W3Schools.com. Either we’ve moved on and don’t look back, or we look back with fondness
  and think there’s no real harm. I’ve read a lot of comments on this topic where the W3Schools are complimented for the no-knowledge-needed explanations. Sadly, thought learning may be made easy, what people are learning is a set of bad
  habits and incorrect theories. There is a general tendency, because there isn’t another source as readily available, we should forgive it for being decidedly less than perfect. To me that sounds just a bit too much like an excuse for
  staying with a wife beater, but hey,

</p>
<p>
  Things, however, might be about to change. A few brave souls have bundled together their wisdom and knowledge and decided to take on the task of clearing up this mess. Only not in the way you might think. Remember that Git repository I
  mentioned? It’s named <a title="w3fools > paulirish > github.com" href="https://github.com/paulirish/w3fools" target="_blank">W3Fools</a>. It is a self-descibed Takedown of W3Schools. Despite
  its&nbsp;maintained&nbsp;popularity there are <a title="HTML and CSS Tutorials. And Stuff > HtmlDog.com/" href="http://htmldog.com/" target="_blank">plenty of</a>
  <a title="Prime source for browser compatibility information on the Internet > Quirksmode" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/" target="_blank">other</a>
  <em><a title="Web design tutorials, articles and community > SitePoint.com" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/" target="_blank">better</a> </em>
  <a title="Web Developer Community > Mozilla Developer Network " href="http://developer.mozilla.org/web/" target="_blank">resources</a> out there gaining ground. Besides, giants have been toppled
  before. Remember Goliath? Or
  <a title="Experts-Exchange versus StackOverflow" href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=%22stackoverflow%22,+%22expert+exchange%22" target="_blank">Experts-exchange</a>?
</p>
<p>
  The site <a title="A Takedown of W3Schools > W3Fools.com" href="http://w3fools.com/" target="_blank">W3Fools</a> has been registered but will not launch until next week, so this should be fun to
  watch unravel!
