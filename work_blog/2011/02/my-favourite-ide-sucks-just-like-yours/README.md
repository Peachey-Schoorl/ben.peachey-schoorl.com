    My favourite IDE sucks and so does yours…
  </a>
</h1>
<p>
  After having started out in notepad and then &nbsp;notepadd++ I remember switching to an IDE and having feelings of both great relieve and great frustration. Although an IDE adds lots of extra features that can greatly improve your
  productivity, as always, there is a price to pay. Not to mention the learning curve, plugin-herding is one of the things that keeps cropping up. So after having given up on PhpEclipse because it fell behind of the PHP releases and then
  giving up on Eclipse PDT because it is (and always will be) a crippleware verzion of te Zend Plugin for Eclipse, I switched to Netbeans. Sure, there were some dearly missed features and functionality, but at least it didn’t hold me back.
  That all changed when the demands I had from my IDE grew and Netbeans just couldn’t keep up. So I feel it is time for another switch. But where to go? I have been around the block, looked at all the options and nothing really fits.
  There’s always something missing… This has lead me to postulate the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong> <em>All </em>IDEs suck. They all just suck at different things.</strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  But as they say, a change is as good as a break. To improve upon matters, there’s a new kid on the block: PhpStorm. Created by the same brains that brought us IntelliJ. It has already been tried and recommended by several acquaintances,
  so it must be good at <em>something. </em>So…<em> </em>for the coming weeks (or at least the coming days) I’ll be giving it a spin. It isn’t a stable release yet, but hopes are high!
